Samsung Galaxy s7,"'Just upgraded from a 3-year-old Android...such an improvement, especially the speed of the system and the camera.  The battery was being used very quickly until the ""performance mode"" was changed, from ""high performance"" to ""optimized""  - thus saving battery power - so I'd recommend doing this unless you need, i.e., everything running on your device or things like having the brightest screen at all times.  This phone can also be charged ""wirelessly"" with a wireless charger that you place the phone on - no connection needed!  Have only had the phone 1 week but am happy so far.  Only negative is the high cost of this device and lack of a 2-year contract, which used to keep the price down.",4/12/2017,Slick and great features,JC 83

Samsung Galaxy s14,"The Samsung S7 is a very solid, well built, phone.  It's all metal with solid switches.
The max microSD cap is 200 GByte, which San Disk produces.  The battery is not replaceable, so getting an ANKER 10000 mAHour external battery was a logical choice for me (this battery is cheap at Amazon).
I cannot sort my music by date, cause unknown.  I take the SAME microSD disc with the songs, and insert into the OLD Samsung S4 and sort by date works.  I relocate the disc to the S7, and the sort by date doesn't work correctly.  Phone or PlayerPro?
Still, I love the phone.  It's very fast.",4/11/2017,"Samsung S7 solid, well built, looks good.",SamsSon

Samsung Galaxy s28,Coming form a Samsung Galaxy S4 it was an easy transition to the S7.  The camera is exceptional and the other functions are easily used and similar to the S4.

The Gold color is gorgeous! It was VERY simple to transfer all of my old phone to this one, even with switching carriers, I was extremely impressed with that part. I had considered the Edge, but went with this one because I can be a tad clumsy and I'm glad that I did because I've already dropped this one and not caused any damage to it.

Samsung Galaxy s238,"After I bought a Vizio e-series tv, I decided to upgrade my phone, as the Vizio uses apps on the cellphone to control streaming online content. Not only do the two devices function seamlessly together, but compared to my old Samsung Galaxy s3, the s7 is beautiful (the gold-on-platinum finish is so striking, I bought a transparent phone case for it), light, fast, incredibly user-friendly, charges rapidly (less than an hour), and holds a charge throughout a long, busy day. The screen is big without being too big, and for an added bonus, the earbuds included with the phone sound much better than you'd expect, particularly when paired with the Poweramp music player app available on the Google Play Store.",2/9/2017,I'm very happy that I decided not to buy an iPhone 7.,billybangdouglas

Samsung Galaxy s255,"I have been a galaxy fan for years. Had my s4 since that first came out, and I was hesitant  to upgrade since I liked that one so much. This s7 is way better and faster than the s4 and it was exactly what I was hoping for. The ease of moving pictures and numbers over was much easier than anticipated. Personally, I think for the price of the phone it should have included the wireless charger. This phone was more than my rent, which is probably  another reason I was hesitant  to switch, but I needed a new phone and I am glad it was worth the switch.",2/3/2017,Nice upgrade from s4,Kelsey8183

Samsung Galaxy s265,I have a samsung galaxy s7 and it is so much better then the s5. It's a little bit more bigger and playing games on it is a lot better and not to talk about the gigabytes (32) a lot more then the s5 down side is it doesn't have a place to put an SD card but other then that I would recommend this phone to anyone.

Samsung Galaxy s266,"After spending two comfortable years with the S4, I was apprehensive of having to start all over with a new phone. Enter a wonderful Verizon Rep at the local store who answered all my questions and was there for me when I needed help with a few of the newer bells and whistles.

Samsung Galaxy s274,"I went back to the Galaxy S series after a few years with the Motorola Droid. I am completely satisified with everything the phone has to offer except the battery life. I have to charge it atleast twice a day. Thank goodness for the rapid charge feature.  I really don't feel like I use it as much as others but the battery drains really fast. I'm not a big app user. My biggest use is on facebook while looking at pics. However, even being idle at night, it rapidly drains. I've turned off most of my notifications. too.  Anyway, the size is perfect for me - not too big, not too small. It's got everything I need and more.",1/26/2017,Love the phone! Hate the battery life!,ReneeN

Samsung Galaxy s286,"I was a huge fan of the Nokia Lumia line of phones, but Verizon stopped carrying the upgrades for this line, and the selection of Windows apps was dismal. Switching to this phone has been great - there are an indefinite number of apps for Google Play, it's user-friendly, and it has some great capabilities with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. While I feel that my Nokia Lumia took better nighttime photos, I am overall happy with this phone's camera and the ease with which I can turn data, wifi and location on and off and the ""power save"" mode, all which help save on battery life. There is very little that I miss from my old phone - mostly a couple of games specific to Windows/Xbox. Every app I had on that phone, there are at least 5 similar offerings on Google Play. Also love that it isn't too large for my small girl-hands to hold.",1/22/2017,"Loved my Windows phone, but this is a great replacement!",krystlechc

Transferring information from the iOS was easy too. Unlike iTunes, Samsung is made to be a compatible devise per each individual user. I love this phone. Obviously being waterproof is an outstanding perk. I used to think the battery life of the iOS was something to be proud of, but the galaxy s7 has a tremendous battery life and charges 100% faster. That helps so you don't go to bed with your phone plugged in and when it's done charging it doesn't just continually burn up the battery. You charge it as its needed and that's that. So far I have yet to find anything I dislike about the Samsung Galaxy s7.

Samsung Galaxy s335,"I got my phone a couple of months ago after upgrading from the Galaxy S5 and have no problems with it. I can go a whole day without charging until night time and then there are days I do have to charge during the day. It all depends on how I use my phone. I have a lot of apps that was transferred from the Galaxy  S5 but haven't activate all of them. If I had activated all of them, then I would be charging my phone twice or more a day.  BTW  I like the new style charger because the the hardly feels hot to the touch.I do have minor complaints.
1- Not happy with a removable battery. It was the only I could shut off my other phones when they froze. This phone hasn't frozen so far.
2- Being made of glass. More of a risk of being cracked. That was one of the reasons why I didn't want the iPhone.
3- Needs sensitivity touch control when wearing gloves in the winter which they had on the Galaxy S5.
4- Needs voice commands when using a Bluetooth when driving. I had that command when I had a flip phone (I forgot which cell phone company had that. All I had to do was press the button on my Bluetooth and the voice commands came on.) so why can't a smart phone have it without going to the PlayStore and downloading Google Voice? It should be automatically programmed into the phone just like my old flip phone?Otherwise, I am very happy with the phone.

Samsung Galaxy s338,"The S7 is what I wanted when I bought my old S4!There are several advantages over my old S4. The responsiveness is vastly improved. The extra memory (32G vs 16G) allows for many more apps. I had hit the limit with the S4. The camera works the way that you would expect a good one to work. The one in the S4 was more often than not a disappointment. The S7 camera focuses nearly instantaneously and can be set to track and stay focused on the object (person, hawk flying, etc.). The delay in the S4 was always frustrating and it would often re-focus on the wrong object in the frame.One thing to be aware of is the need for a good protective cover. The phone is slippery! I purchased a Spigen cover with a protective plastic edge that both looks great and is functional. It does not cover the side buttons. I might switch to one like I had on the S4 that does cover the buttons because it is too easy to accidentally press the power button on the side and wake the phone, but that's in the personal preference area. The cover should have a ridge above the screen because on the S7 the glass sits proud of the edge, exposed in a drop.The battery life is much better than it is in the S4 as well.I can say that I haven't found anything negative to report on the S7 itself. I wouldn't have any other.",1/12/2017,Definitely an improvment over my S4.,dlr77

Samsung Galaxy s478,"The phone its self is pretty solid, well built, and so far reliable. I dropped my phone (inside an otter box defender case) from a 12' roof into water about 4"" deep. I didn't realize it had fallen out of my nail bags but when I found the phone, it still functioned fine. I attribute the 'crash protection' of the case to the drop protection but the phone its self did not allow water to enter, as advertised.The new version of Android is easier to use in some ways, but some features are a little harder to find. Such as stopping the download manager, and the developer features. But this is partly learning curve for the newest android version. Texting over a wifi network is also a great benefit for me. Overall the phone and the Android OS are working well with no issues. I remain solidly convinced that Samsung makes one of the best phones on the market at the moment.1. Battery life under heavy use with wifi and Bluetooth on is about 14 hours. I have stretched that to 4 days without charging if I turn on the power saving features in the settings drop down.
2. Call quality is outstanding and easy to hear and understand even on speaker. 
3. Charging time is rather short, about an 45 minutes- hour from 1% to 100% even when all features (wifi, bluetooth) are still on. 
4. Camera functions well, taking great photos in all conditions so far. The magnify feature is also VERY useful for me and shows an extremely clear close up view of anything that is more than 5 inches from the camera.
5. The Google play app for music is a little hard to navigate, but I don't listen to much music on my phone. However the music from the phone is very clean/clear and loud enough to be heard clearly over normal talking and chatter.",12/30/2016,"Phone is reliable, robust, and easy to use if you come from an Android phone already.",I dont have a nick name

Samsung Galaxy s631,Coming from Motorola phones this was a huge performance increase. My old Droid was touted as the best battery lasting device. I was lucky to go 10 hours even when new. This S7 puts that Motorola to shame along either a better camera that doesn't hesitate when snapping a shot. I mostly use my phone as a phone but the additional features I do use are much faster and smoother. Very satisfied.,12/9/2016,Great phone!,FFR1812

Samsung Galaxy s635,"I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago to upgrade from my S5 and I am very happy with performance so far.  It was very easy to transfer over all of my data and apps with Verizon Cloud and Content Transfer. I have all of my messages, pictures, and documents.  I really like the fingerprint function to unlock my phone which makes it secure and quick to access. I also enjoy that it is slightly smaller in width than the S5 which is easier for me to hold and fit into pockets.",12/17/2016,Easy to transfer from S5 to S7,NightPsych

Samsung Galaxy s638,"I upgraded to the Galaxy S7 from the Galaxy S5. So far it is working better than my previous phone regarding speed and a few more features.I love the increased access to my most used apps on my home page. Previously the app icon access was limited requiring scroll to other pages to find apps. I haven't had time to explore much of it's capability or the picture quality yet but hope too soon. I love the notifications, time, date and battery display with the Always on Display feature without unlocking the phone. The Smart Switch app (and the Verizon rep) made it easy to transfer the old data/apps from my previous phone to the S7. Also love that unsaved callers are identified now with calls. Will make it easier to avoid/block telemarketer calls and to add new friends to my contacts. The option for 2 apps on the Lock screen is also great. I love that the Verizon apps and the Samsung apps are organized into separate files and not with the rest of the apps - makes it easier to find. The only negative thing is the sensitivity of the screen/key board is not quite as good as my last phone. I often have to repeatedly press the screen to finish a text. I have been very pleased with my Samsung phones and will likely continue with this product line.",12/8/2016,Love the Galaxy S7!,Beth in VA

Samsung Galaxy s676,"The S7 has BY FAR the absolute BEST voice quality I've ever had on a cell phone.  Incoming calls no longer sound like the caller is talking into a tin can!    My wife and I love the display, and all the new ways you can customize it.  Having 32 Gig opens up space for apps for which I did not have room on my previous phone.  I missed the ability to set the ""back"" and ""app history"" buttons to stay lit whenever the phone is in use.  Fortunately, someone wrote an APP for that...and I'm running that.  (those are the hot-spot areas to the immediate LEFT and RIGHT of the actual button at the bottom of the phone).    We also got the fast-charge wireless charging pad, and find it very useful...no longer have to fight with the charging cord to get it ""just right"" to fit into the charge port.",12/6/2016,VERY GLAD We made the upgrade!,Church Organist

When I returned it, I got a iPhone 6S Plus, because I'd never had an iPhone I thought I'd try it. Well I didn't care for the iPhone it was way different than the android phones.I've ALWAYS had android phones so it probably was a big factor in my decision to take it back.

It has a good feel in your hand, fits well in your pocket but it's not so thin that I'm afraid of breaking it if I sit down. It's a Samsung so there's a wide variety of accessories available from both Samsung or third party vendors,  if you're into that. Only one complaint, Samsung has a lot of proprietary software that can't be uninstalled. None of it so far has affected the phones performance, but it does add a lot of clutter and I had to spend some time customizing it.

I love the camera on the S7 - it's much better than any previous versions of the Galaxy that I've had. I really like that they kept a great style and resolution on the phone.

Zoom is very limited, could only zoom to half of screen size vs S7 which is full screen and more. Just got back from WY and the S7 pics are all amazing! It has so many options to adjust for any light level. Easy to use. The phone is fantastic. I have an S5 before this. My only regret is that the camera had 16mp like my S5, not 12mp.

I went online to order for in store pickup. The order got stuck in the system. Five hours later, I had to visit the store to get the order released. Very frustrating.I took the phone home to activate it. I live in a dead zone. I was told, by an employee, that only a good Wi-Fi signal was needed to activate. That is wrong. I had to return to the store to get it activated. Very frustrating. The in store manager was helpful, professional and great help. She made sure I walked away completely satisfied.

Samsung Galaxy s1160,"I have been using the S7 for about a week now, and I'm quite happy with it.
The camera is WAY improved.  Better focus and quicker pictures, even in lower light conditions.  Make sure you get an SD card for the storage, as the increased resolution could eat up your memory quick.
Speaking of SD storage, access to the SD is improved, with storage outside of the battery compartment, sharing space with the SIM card.
Audio is improved - louder and seems better directed towards the user.
The interface itself is nicer.  Samsung didn't go messing with the menus and locations too much, so previous Galaxy users won't get frustrated from thumb memory.
And to be expected, performance from the better chipset is great.
Oh yeah, voice calling does seem better, even in my home's reception blackhole.
They also scooted the power button down a bit, making it easier to reach with the thumb.",10/3/2016,Great improvement over the former Galaxy S5,houston tx

Samsung Galaxy s1212,"So far, only having this Galaxy S7 a week, I'm very happy with it! Yes, I've had to install the video player app since they've inexplicably not included it, but that's not a big deal. I love the inclusion of a graphic equalizer, the improved camera, and the new ability to plug-in a flash drive with the included adapter. I wish they had kept the removable battery layout. The so-called rapid charger is not rapid at all, taking roughly the same amount of time to charge as my old Galaxy S5, and as with the S5, it gets uncomfortably hot during charging, updating, or shooting long videos. I'm glad that they kept the micro SD card option, as it's a deal-maker for me. I would definitely recommend this phone!

Samsung Galaxy s1254,"I had the S1, S3, S5, and now the S7. Each time Samsung has improved the speed, capabilities, and design of the phone. Of course, nothing's perfect, but with each generation I have never had problems with the phone freezing, being frustratingly slow, or not working properly. If you take care of this phone, it will take care of you.Pros: Fast, lots of space, looks great, menu/settings are familiar (so you don't have to learn a whole new settings scheme. This makes it so easy to pick up and go from the previous generations). Although I've used Atom Launcher on my S3, 5, and now 7, the new ""Themes"" option makes it so easy to customize the look of your phone, I wouldn't be surprised if Atom Launcher can't keep up.Cons: ""Always on"" feature...it's a good idea, I use it, but I haven't notice it save the battery at all. In fact, the battery seems to drain faster on the S7 than the S5. Body design...although the phone looks so awesome, you really need to purchase a phone case. The phone body on its own is very slippery. As soon as the oils from your hand get on it, it gets worrisome to hold.",9/20/2016,The Galaxy family continues its win streak,GalaxyFTW

Very fast and easy to use.  They have made improvements over the prior phones.  Only a couple of down sides: 1. Back is glass, which I did not know and got a crack in it the very first day. Lesson - don't use a cheap case. 2. They need to figure out how to make better glass add in screens that fit the whole screen without having the edges come un-stuck. 
3. You can not currently adjust screen sensitivity and this is really not cool. How do you forget to add that as a feature?

Samsung Galaxy s1474,"Bought this phone about three months ago and I can say that I LOVE it!  The Snapdragon 820 processor is amazingly quick.  Camera is by far the best out of the box. If you decide to learn more about the camera options, you can fine tune the phone to match a professional camera.  A 3,000 mAh battery is incredible.  I'm a moderate to heavy user of the phone and I can say that it does me well for a daily driver.  Generally I'm left with about 35% at the end of the day at 10 PM. The water proofing is also amazing!  I've submerged it in a glass of water for about 25ish minutes and it works just fine.  There have been occasions where I've even taken it to a pool to shoot some video and pictures and nothing bad happened.  Just make sure you don't leave it in the pool for more than 30 minutes just for safe keeping.  The body is extremely easy to hold and all buttons are easily accessible. Some extra perks are the fingerprint scanner, super high resolution screen and the wireless charging capabilities! So far I LOVE this phone and this is after six years of iPhone usage.  Best phone on the market and I'll recommend this phone to ANYONE!  Good job, Samsung ;)",8/19/2016,Amazing Phone,DTrick

Samsung Galaxy s1731,"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed my time as abVerizon iPhone user. But, as someone who truly believes these gadgets are meant to simplify life, I found that the iPhone was making mine more complicated. You see, I am a PC user and trying to seamlessly sync my iPhone with my MS Outlook Calendar and Contacts was a constant nightmare. During syncs, contact info would get scrambled. And I hated the fact that iTunes counted how many times I played a song, etc. I also couldn't stand how they controlled my data storage on the device. The Samsung Galaxy S7 really allows me to control my experience- Even the camera is awesome! For very little money, I picked up a SIM card and am now able to really take all of my music and pictures with me without taxing the phone's internal storage. This is the smart phone experience I have been waiting for!",8/7/2016,So much better than the iPhone,HappySamsung7User

Samsung Galaxy s1803,The phone is a big improvement from the S5.  The Android settings are a challenge to get all working the way I would like.  I think some of the explanations of the settings could be written in better language so all could understand them.  A terms dictionary might help.  When I was was working my company gave us a course in writing so all audiences could understand what you were writing in plain language.  That is what is needed here.,8/1/2016,Still getting the settings the way I like them.,Yussel

Samsung Galaxy s1830,"I have the 32GB Black Onyx S7. Previously I had the S6 Edge and both are seamless in terms of performance and design. One of the many features of the S7 thats better than the S6 model if it's expandable memory, which I love since I download a lot of videos, take videos, and take pictures. Another thing is the response time of the touch sensors, despite when using it underwater where in you can mostly just take pictures and such. All the same its an amazing phone and durable too! I'd recommend it to any of my friends, unfortunately they are Apple people so I couldn't convince them otherwise.

Samsung Galaxy s1863,Didn't want to get a new phone but had no choice when my Galaxy 3 wouldn't charge anymore.  I stayed with Galaxy as I have had them in the past and I got the 7 and I love it. Only thing the battery doesn't last as long as they say it does.,7/26/2016,Love the phone.,tracykiki
Samsung Galaxy s1864,"Just upgraded to this phone and I love how much better it is than the one I had before.  The fast charge capability is really amazing when you have a limited time to charge your phone before heading out of the house.  I also love how clear the camera is, especially how well it works with low light situations.  Also a strangely off feature I love is the HD voice feature when talking to someone with the same option on their phone...it sounds like they are right beside you.  Takes away all the extra noises around you, so driving on the highway you can only hear the person, not the sound of the highway they are on.",7/26/2016,"Amazing phone, Glad I upgraded!",kraigers737

Samsung Galaxy s1873,It was very easy to figure out how to do and find most things on the new Galaxy. Call quality is excellent and the camera is so much better than the old one.

Samsung Galaxy s1875,"Purchased this phone less than a month ago as my Galaxy S3 was not only long in the tooth, but becoming very unresponsive to my commands. My charge port was junk so my transition to the S7 was a no-brainer. Immediately GPS back and way better than before. New modem, Snapdragon processor, Cameras front and rear. Video game, YouTube News outlets in 4K robust color. Speed like you wouldn't believe. The photo quality in low light is unsurpassed even by some SLR cameras. This phone does it all and more. If you are a Samsung lover like me then the S7 needs to  be a definite 1st Choice for your upgrade.",11/6/2016,Night and Day,Daffyduck1970

Samsung Galaxy s1880,"I have had a Samsung S3 for over three years, and it has worked wonderfully.  However, the battery started dying too soon, and I took that as a sign to get a new phone.  So now I have the S7.  This a great device.  Very similar in form and function, but I do like the bigger screen.  It is a lot brighter, and I also like how the aps are grouped together.  Overall I really like how easy it is to figure out some of the newer features, as well as the more familiar ones!",7/26/2016,Needed an upgrade,JasonB2809
Samsung Galaxy s1881,"Upgraded only because my S3 mini wasn't compatible with Pokemon GO. Best decision ever. This phone goes all day on normal usages and about 3-4 hrs on Pokemon GO, nonstop (not using energy save mode so im sure you could get another hr of use if it was on). User friendly and easy to navigate.",7/26/2016,Pokemon GO made me do it... no shame...,Asherdink

Samsung Galaxy s1886,Ive been an iPhone user from the start beginning with the iPad touch then upgraded to the phone. I was getting bored with it and neededa change. I was told by friends that I would hate switching from an iPhone to an android but honestly I have no regrets. Both phones are very similar yet very different. But I just like my galaxy s7 much better.,7/25/2016,Absolutely love it!,Pinkglitter83

Samsung Galaxy s1892,"The Galaxy S7 is a new and phone.  I like the way you an charge it with the expensive charging stand.
I have only had it a week and Thanks to Verison cloud I was able to save most everything.  
The address book, Contacts are still a mess. Some I can edit some I can not. Don't know why. I just had to delete some and re enter them.  Seem to have a mess between  phone contacts and message contacts.  The new message center is a mess. Glad the old one is still available.Why can't you personalize the lock screen picture you could on the 5?
I think I should stop here.  I preached to my kids that if you can't say something nice don't say anything.",7/25/2016,not all that is new is better,ttrpt

Samsung Galaxy s1898,"I lost my LGG3 a couple of weeks ago and was in need for a new phone that is water resistant and has a decent battery life. I chose this phone because of the water resistance. I'mean pretty impressed with how intuitive the keyboard is, battery life and water durability. The voice quality is pretty impressive as well. Overall I say it's the best phone I've ever owned.
